MySearchLab Exposition Music is an online platform that provides students with interactive assessments and feedback for each chapter of the textbook. Students can practice their skills by dragging and dropping notation on a staff, listening to their choices, and identifying or constructing intervals, key signatures, scales, chords, melodies, harmonies, and more. The platform also offers pretests, post-tests, and chapter reviews to help students monitor their progress and prepare for exams.
 
Music Analysis in Context is a new feature that introduces students to the process of analyzing music in relation to its historical, cultural, and stylistic context. Each chapter includes an analysis of a musical work from a variety of genres and periods, such as classical, jazz, rock, pop, world music, and film music. The analysis focuses on the elements of music that are relevant to the chapter topic, such as rhythm, meter, pitch, scale, mode, interval, chord, melody, harmony, texture, form, style, and expression. Students are guided through a discovery of the relationship between phrases and the overall form of the work, as well as the meaning and function of the music within its context.
 
The sixth edition also emphasizes listening, composition, and performance as essential aspects of musicianship. The textbook includes a set of compact discs that contain recordings of all the musical examples and exercises in the book. Students are encouraged to listen actively and critically to the music they study and create. The textbook also offers a variety of exercises and projects that challenge students to apply their knowledge and skills creatively. For example, students can compose their own melodies or harmonies using given guidelines or models; improvise over chord progressions or modes; perform rhythmic or melodic dictation; sing intervals or scales; play melodies or chords on an instrument; or analyze a musical work of their choice.
 
Fundamentals of Music 6th Edition is a comprehensive and engaging textbook that provides students with a solid foundation in music theory and musicianship. It is suitable for introductory courses in music fundamentals or music appreciation at the college level. It is also a valuable resource for self-study or review for musicians of any level or background.
  
In addition to the textbook and the online platform, the sixth edition also includes an instructor's manual and a test bank. The instructor's manual contains learning objectives, chapter guides, review sets, calligraphy tips, tricks of the trade, building skills exercises, creative projects, analysis in context exercises, and musicianship exercises for each chapter. The test bank contains multiple choice, true/false, matching, short answer, and essay questions for each chapter. These resources can help instructors plan their courses and assess their students' learning outcomes.
